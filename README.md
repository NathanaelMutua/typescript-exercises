# TypeScript Fundamentals & Data Structures Challenges

This repository contains two milestone challenge sets designed to help you master core TypeScript concepts and data structure fundamentals. Below is a quick overview of each milestone:

## Milestones Overview

### Milestone 1: Data Structures
**Path: `milestone_1_challenges`**  
**Challenges: 16**  
Focuses on essential data manipulation techniques including:

- Array operations (sum, filter, search)
- Object property handling
- Basic algorithm implementation
- Data aggregation and transformation

```ts
// Example challenge: Find maximum value
findMax([3, 7, 2, 9, 5]); // Returns 9
```

### Milestone 2: TypeScript Fundamentals
**Path: `milestone_2_challenges`**  
**Challenges: 15**  
Covers core programming concepts:

- Variables and data types
- Functions and scope
- Conditional logic
- Mathematical operations
- Loop implementations

```ts
// Example challenge: FizzBuzz
fizzBuzzCheck(15); // Returns "FizzBuzz"
```

## Learning Progression

1. **Start with Milestone 1**  
   Apply your fundamentals to solve data manipulation challenges

2. **Advance to Milestone 2**  
   Build foundational TypeScript skills before tackling data structures

3. **Combined Skills**  
   Solutions often combine techniques from both milestones

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to a milestone folder
3. Run:
    ```bash 
    npm install 
    ```
3. Implement solutions in `.ts` files
4. Test with provided examples
5. Check against sample solutions (when available)

Happy coding.
